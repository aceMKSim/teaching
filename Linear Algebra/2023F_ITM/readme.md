# Quiz 1 - partial credit policy

## Problem 1

+ You must state the definition, not the related theorem. They are different things.
+ If the definition is stated with a minor error, then 5pts were given.
+ If the related theorem is stated correctly, then 5pts were given.

## Problem 2

+ Your work must follow the flow.
  1. row vectors indep.
  2. consider the transpose
  3. determinant of the transpose matrix is zero
  4. determinant of the original matrix is same, thus zero.
  5. col vectors of the original matrix is indep.
+ If you didn't exactly follow the above flow, then you are missing some logical flow.

## Problem 3, 4

+ No partial credit were given.

## Problem 5

+ If the proof has only a minor error, then 10pts were given.
