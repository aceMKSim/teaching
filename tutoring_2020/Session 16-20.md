### "To Have or To Be" - Erich Fromm

Learning

> Students in the having mode of existence will listen to a lecture, hearing the words and understanding their logical structure and their meaning
and, as best they can, will write down every word in their looseleaf notebooks—so that, later on, they can memorize their notes and thus pass
an examination. But the content does not become part of their own individual system of thought, enriching and widening it. Instead, they
transform the words they hear into fixed clusters of thought, or whole theories, which they store up. The students and the content of the lectures
remain strangers to each other, except that each student has become the owner of a collection of statements made by somebody else (who had
either created them or taken them over from another source). 

> Students in the having mode have but one aim: to hold onto what they "learned," either by entrusting it firmly to their memories or by carefully
guarding their notes. They do not have to produce or create something new. In fact, the having–type individuals feel rather disturbed by new
thoughts or ideas about a subject, because the new puts into question the fixed sum of information they have. Indeed, to one for whom having is the
main form of relatedness to the world, ideas that cannot easily be pinned down (or penned down) are frightening—like everything else that grows
and changes, and thus is not controllable. 

> The process of learning has an entirely different quality for students inthe being mode of relatedness to the world. To begin with, they do not go to the course lectures, even to the first one in a course, as tabulae rasae. They have thought beforehand about the problems the lectures will be dealing with and have in mind certain questions and problems of their own. They have been occupied with the topic and it interests them. Instead of being passive receptacles of words and ideas, they listen, they hear, and most important, they receive and they respond in an active, productive way. What they listen to stimulates their own thinking processes. New questions, new ideas, new perspectives arise in their minds. Their listening is an alive process. They listen with interest, hear what the lecturer says, and spontaneously come to life in response to what they hear. They do not simply acquire knowledge that they can take home and memorize. Each student has been affected and has changed: each is different after the lecture than he or she was before it. Of course, this mode of learning can prevail only if the lecture offers stimulating material. Empty talk cannot be responded to in the being mode, and in such circumstances, students in the being mode find it best not to listen at all, but to concentrate on their own thought processes.
