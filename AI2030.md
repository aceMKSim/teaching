## Motivation

+ Is AI(Artificial intelligence) imaginary creature that dominate mankind?

![AI-based robot in movies]()

+ The computer/machine to be intelligent like human, in the way people use their body to sense, learn, reason, and take action.
+ In reality, AI is changing our daily lives, improving
    + Human health
    + Safety
    + Productivity
+ Is AI threat to our lives?
    + There is no race of superhuman robot yet.
    + Potential abuse is concern.
    + There are more positive sides.

## What are the expected changes?

+ Anticipation on AI
    + Driving safer
    + Helping children to learn
    + Extend and enhance people's lives
+ AI applications are already in many places nearyby
    + Schools
    + Homes
    + Hospitals
+ It is primary concern of
    + Universities, where AI studies are conducted in many departments.
    + Technology firms including Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft.
    + Even Hollywood.

## I hope you will ask and find answers of the following questions.

+ What will be like our future life?
    + What will disappear in near future?
    + What will newly appear and around my life?
    + How am I respond to the changes?
+ What will be my role and career?
    + What am I good at? 
    + What are the area or my skill that I make use of my unique traits.

# I. Transportation

## Motivation

+ Self-driving car will drive people.
+ The first and foremost change within 10 years!
+ Less importance in living in a city, heavily changing population density.
+ Self-driving is applied to trucks, flying vehicle, and personal robots.

## Smarter cars

### Cars can feel and react like human

+ GPS was first introduced to first car in 2001.
+ Now, smartphone with GPS provides connectivity.
+ Cars now have sensing capabilities including
    + gyroscopes (orientation and angular change)
    + accelerometers (accelation)
    + ambient light sensors
    + moisture sensors
    + speed, wheel position (before 21st century)

### Cars have been surprisingly transformed

+ Recent deveopments
    + Parking assistant - Since 2003
    + Parking Summon - Since 2016, Tesla
    + Lane departure warning - Since 2004
    + Cruise control - Since 2005
    + Blind spot monitoring - Since 2007
    + Lane changing - Since 2015
+ In these days, cars can
    + parking themselves
    + adaptive cruise control
    + stop-and-go traffic
    + alerting driver
    + Pre-collision systems to let cars autonomously brake (highly expert driver)

## Self-driving vehicles

### Self-drving car has been mankind's long dream

+ In 1930s, science fictions were first written.
+ In 1960s, AI community starts to attempt.
+ In 2000s, the dream has come true for sea, sky, and even on Mars.

### Driving in a city? - different problem

+ But, driving in a city seemed too complex problem, because of
    + pedistrians
    + heavy traffic
    + many unexpected events

![Driving in a city]()

### Rapid develeopments

+ In 2004-2012, advances in sensing and machine learning for perception task.
    + Google's self-driving cars
    + Tesla to develop software
    + Semi-autonomous vehicle - drivers are engaged and take over in case of potential problem
+ In 2020, super-human performance!
    + Tesla
    + Tesla

![Tesla car]()

+ Most people in US expect to buy next car to be self-driving

##

### Different world

+ Different life-style
    + A commuter in US spends 50 minutes driving per day.
    + This would become work time or entertainment time.
    + Commuting would have increased comfort and decreased cognitive load.
+ Less burden of commuting affects place to live.
    + Less population in the city.
    + More spacious livings in suburbs.
+ Reduced need for parking changes design of city and public space.
+ Freedom of mobility for youth, elderly, and disabled.

### Discussion

+ Do we need to possess a car any more if shared vehicles are avilable?
    + I want my car as my own place vs I will share with people for economy. 
+ Will we still need public transportation?
    + Many people in one vehicle is efficient vs People have different origin-destination
+ What happens if hackers to attack unmanned cars? How to prevent?
    + Kidnapping, car bombing? Anti-hacking to fight against hacking?
+ In situation where human injury or death is inevitable, whom to put at risk?
    + Car is to drive human safely vs less number of victim is primary concern.
+ In the absence of possible car accident, how should car be made?
    + Seat belt is still necessary? Airbag?
    + Steel? Wood? Plastic? Cement?
